            <p>Do you love the hunt each year or hate it?  Do you have a different list for each child?  
            How do you know which store has the best prices?  Are you on the phone at one store 
            while your best friend is at another so you can price shop?  Do your kids ask for twenty 
            more items than actually needed?</p>
            <p>Let us take all the questions out of the problem for you.  LOVE the hunt this year.  Get 
            the BEST prices guaranteed.  SURPRISE each child with their own box of school supplies and  
            meet your best friend for lunch instead of tag team shopping.</p>

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The company School Supply Box was founded by two moms that were fed up with the 
            annual hunt for school supplies and wanted to make the process much easier 
            for the moms that came behind us.  Because we buy in bulk, we are able to negotiate 
            much better prices than regular stores have.  We are also able to eliminate 
            the problem of needing to hunt at different stores, saving moms an enormous amount 
            of time.  We stay away from generic brands and buy the brand names that represent 
            the best quality such as Crayola, Ticonderoga, Sharpie, Pilot, and Mead.  Our kids 
            loved the boxes we found to put your child's supplies in.  We know yours will 
            be excited about opening their personal boxes in the mail.  Let our struggles solve 
            the Annual School Supply Hunt for you.</p>
